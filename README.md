Array Sorting Project
This project was developed as part of the Algorithms II course (2024/2) and focuses on implementing and testing array sorting and searching algorithms in C. The primary goal was to explore both recursive and iterative approaches to classic algorithms.

Implemented Algorithms:
Sequential Search (naive)
Binary Search
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Merge Sort
Features:
Secure programming practices in C, including memory validation and proper allocation.
Modular implementation using provided function prototypes.
A main.c file for running predefined test cases.
Usage:
Compile the program using the provided template or a standard GCC command. The resulting executable runs test cases to validate the implementations.
