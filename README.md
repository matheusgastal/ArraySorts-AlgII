Sorting Arrays Project.
This project was created as part of the Algorithms II course (2024/2) and focuses on implementing and testing sorting and searching algorithms for arrays in C. The main objective was to dive into both recursive and iterative approaches to classic algorithms, helping to build a deeper understanding of how they work and their performance in different situations.

The project includes several important algorithms, such as sequential search (naive), binary search, and three types of sorting: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort. Each algorithm was carefully implemented to help showcase its logic and efficiency, while also offering insight into its complexity.

A key aspect of the project was paying attention to secure programming practices in C. This means making sure memory is correctly allocated and validated to ensure the program runs smoothly and reliably. The project was built with modularity in mind, following function prototypes for clear and organized code. Additionally, the main.c file runs predefined test cases to validate that everything is working as expected.

To use the project, simply compile it using the provided template or a standard GCC command. The executable will run a set of test cases to confirm that the algorithms are implemented correctly and produce the right results.
